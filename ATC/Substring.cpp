Problem Statement
Given are two strings 
S
 and 
T
.

Let us change some of the characters in 
S
 so that 
T
 will be a substring of 
S
.

At least how many characters do we need to change?

Here, a substring is a consecutive subsequence. For example, xxx is a substring of yxxxy, but not a substring of xxyxx.

Constraints
The lengths of 
S
 and 
T
 are each at least 
1
 and at most 
1000
.
The length of 
T
 is at most that of 
S
.
S
 and 
T
 consist of lowercase English letters.
