Problem Statement
There are 
N
 cities numbered 
1
 through 
N
, and 
M
 bidirectional roads numbered 
1
 through 
M
. Road 
i
 connects City 
A
i
 and City 
B
i
.

Snuke can perform the following operation zero or more times:

Choose two distinct cities that are not directly connected by a road, and build a new road between the two cities.
After he finishes the operations, it must be possible to travel from any city to any other cities by following roads (possibly multiple times).

What is the minimum number of roads he must build to achieve the goal?
