Problem Statement
Takahashi, who lives on the number line, is now at coordinate 
X
. He will make exactly 
K
 moves of distance 
D
 in the positive or negative direction.

More specifically, in one move, he can go from coordinate 
x
 to 
x
+
D
 or 
x
−
D
.

He wants to make 
K
 moves so that the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination will be the smallest possible.

Find the minimum possible absolute value of the coordinate of the destination.
