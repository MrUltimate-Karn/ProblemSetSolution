Problem Statement
On the 
x
y
-plane, We have 
N
 points numbered 
1
 to 
N
. Point 
i
 is at 
(
x
i
,
y
i
)
, and the 
x
-coordinates of the 
N
 points are pairwise different.

Find the number of pairs of integers 
(
i
,
j
)
 
(
i
<
j
)
 that satisfy the following condition:

The line passing through Point 
i
 and Point 
j
 has a slope between 
−
1
 and 
1
 (inclusive).
