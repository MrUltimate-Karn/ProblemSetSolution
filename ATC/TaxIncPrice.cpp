Problem Statement
The consumption tax rate in the Republic of ARC is 
t
 percent, where 
t
 is a positive integer.

There is a shop called Seisu-ya (integer shop) there. It sells each positive integer 
A
 for 
A
 yen (Japanese currency) excluding tax, that is, 
⌊
100
+
t
100
A
⌋
 yen including tax. Here, 
⌊
x
⌋
 denotes the largest integer not greater than 
x
 for a real number 
x
.

Although Seisu-ya sells every positive integer, there are some positive integer values that cannot be the tax-included price of an integer. Among those values, find the 
N
-th smallest value.
