Problem Statement
For a sequence 
a
=
(
a
1
,
a
2
,
a
3
,
…
,
a
k
)
, let 
f
(
a
)
 be the sum of its elements after the following is done:

For each 
i
=
1
,
2
,
3
,
…
,
k
, in this order, do the following operation:
add the current maximum value of an element in 
a
 to 
a
i
.
You are given a sequence of length 
N
: 
A
=
(
A
1
,
A
2
,
A
3
,
…
,
A
N
)
.
For each integer 
k
 between 
1
 and 
N
 (inclusive), find 
f
(
a
)
 when 
a
=
(
A
1
,
A
2
,
A
3
,
…
,
A
k
)
.
