Problem Statement
We have sticks numbered 
1
,
⋯
,
N
. The length of Stick 
i
 
(
1
≤
i
≤
N
)
 is 
L
i
.

In how many ways can we choose three of the sticks with different lengths that can form a triangle?

That is, find the number of triples of integers 
(
i
,
j
,
k
)
 
(
1
≤
i
<
j
<
k
≤
N
)
 that satisfy both of the following conditions:

L
i
, 
L
j
, and 
L
k
 are all different.
There exists a triangle whose sides have lengths 
L
i
, 
L
j
, and 
L
k
.
