A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters "(" and ")". A regular bracket sequence (or, shortly, an RBS) is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "1" and "+" between the original characters of the sequence. For example:
bracket sequences "()()" and "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)" and "((1+1)+1)");
bracket sequences ")(", "(" and ")" are not.
You are given a string s, which is an RBS. You can apply any number of operations to this string. Each operation can have one of the following types:
choose some non-empty prefix of s and remove it from s, so s is still an RBS. For example, we can apply this operation as follows: "(())()(())()()" → "()()" (the first 10 characters are removed);
choose some contiguous non-empty substring of s and remove it from s, so s is still an RBS. For example, we can apply this operation as follows: "(())()(())()()" → "(())()()()" (the characters from the 7-th to the 10-th are removed).
The operation 2 can be applied at most k times. Calculate the maximum number of operations you can apply until s becomes empty.
Input
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤105) — the number of test cases.
Each test case is described by two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2≤n≤2⋅105; 1≤k≤n; n is even) — the length of s and the maximum number of operations of type 2 you can apply.
The second line contains a string s of n characters '(' and ')'. This string is an RBS.
The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105.
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of operations you can apply.
