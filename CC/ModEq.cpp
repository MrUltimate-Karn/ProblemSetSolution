/*
Given integers N and M, find the number of ordered pairs (a,b) such that 1≤a<b≤N and ((M mod a) mod b)=((M mod b) mod a)

.
Input

    The first line contains an integer T

, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The only line of each test case contains two integers N
, M

    .

Output

For each testcase, output in a single line the answer to the problem.
Constraints

    1≤T≤1000

2≤N≤106
1≤M≤5⋅105
The sum of N
over all test cases does not exceed 106.
